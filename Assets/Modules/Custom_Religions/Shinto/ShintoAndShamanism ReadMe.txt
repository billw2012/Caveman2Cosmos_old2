"I may have found a way to potentially add Shinto to available religions.

Aaranda originally made it available after researching Feudalism, but historically, the religion has been synonymous with Japanese civilization from the beginning of its written history.  So it would involve a new, but early age technology, along the lines of Dualism providing Zoroastrianism.

If this were to be done, I would also add an early age structure for this tech, just so that researching this wouldn't be such a dead end like Dualism (only providing a religion and the Hanging Gardens).

To clarify, Aaranda made all of his religions available through existing technologies  (Feudalism for Shinto, Naturopathy for Druidism, Mysticism for Animism, Music for Yoruba, Fundamentalism for Voodoo).  I just felt that it seemed more fitting that Shinto be an early Asian religion not so laborious to reach for, unlike Confucianism (Code of Laws), which already has Monarchy and Writing as its prereqs."

[LIST]
[*]Missionary - Kannushi (3 max)
[*]Holy Shrine - Ise Jingu (Ise Grand Shrine)
[*]Unique Promotion  -  Bushido.  To fully associate Bushido with warmongering would be a bit much, so this seemed more reasonable.  If it didn't clash with Afforess' latest Martial Arts promotions, I would have added [B]Free Martial Arts Promotion[/B], normally available with Buddhism and Taoism.  [B]Note:[/B] AAranda's religions modmod has three promotions already Bushido 1, Bushido 2, and Bushido 3.
