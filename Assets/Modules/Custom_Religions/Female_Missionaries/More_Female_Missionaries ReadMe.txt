This unit set contains 10 female versions of different religion missionaries (Andean, Asatru, Confucian, Druidic, Hellenism, Kemetism, Mesopotamien, Shaman, Shinto and Tengri). Only the models are inclueded, no new religions will be added to the game with this set. However, the download contains a modular mod that will add all the models as replacement for the Confucian missionary to the game. This way, they can be quickly inspected in-game and the necessary XML entries are available.

This set is an addition to my Female Missionaries ModComp (http://forums.civfanatics.com/downloads.php?do=file&id=14863) and the new missionaries should be addable to a game with extra religions like it is described there. But of course they can be used in other ways, too.
