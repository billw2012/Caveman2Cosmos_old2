The compressed file contains the weaponised Andromeda Strain stuff.

It needs to be looked at further to convert it into a big event and then have one outcome of the event being the weaponisation of it.

Would need spy missions to steal knowledge which may cause new outbreaks and use of may allow others to be able to weaponise. Maybe a UN resolution on banning?


The idea.

Some low probibility event in the modern age causes the Andromeda Strain to land somewhere on "Earth" in an advanced nation.

At first it only affects one plot (2-5 turns?)

Then it spreads about 1 plot per turn based on wind.

After x turns it mutates to a harmless form.

Effects - like Gods of Old blight.
