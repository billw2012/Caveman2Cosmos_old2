This resource is a converted model from Atlantica Online. Therefore, although I made some modifications, I take no credit for the artwork and all rights are within NDOORS Corporation of course.

The whole resource nif has a polycount of about 1800 triangles. It uses a 128*128 dds file for the artwork.

The unit uses its original AO animation that I converted for Civ4.
