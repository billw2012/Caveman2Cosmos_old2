Savanna

Just a copy of the jungle but without alpha graphics for tiny grass and their shadow.
So the graphics of the former jungle will be full calculated but there will be shown the palm trees only.

This was first made for my ancient Mod Pie's Ancient Europe. Enjoy!

Made by Pie (pie_at).
